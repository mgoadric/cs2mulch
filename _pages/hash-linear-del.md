## Goals

Students will understand elements of the deletion algorithm
for open addressing with linear probing in hash tables.

## Materials

One deck of [Menagerie]({{site.baseurl}}/hash) cards.

## Video

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//4v33HcICoa4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

## Setup

Give each student a set of 0-7 number cards. Set these cards in a
row, ordered from 0 on the left to 7 on the right.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/numbercards.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Number cards from the Menagerie deck." %}

Shuffle the animal cards from the deck and deal each student 9 cards.

Each student should use 6 of their cards and follow the
[insertion algorithm]({{site.baseurl}}/hash/linear).
