## Goals

Students will understand elements of the removal algorithm
for binary search trees.

## Materials

One deck of [Before the Birds]({{site.baseurl}}/tree) cards.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bg.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Sample cards from the tree deck." %}

## Setup

Shuffle the deck and deal each student 9 cards.

Each student will shuffle their 9 cards, and then create a
binary tree as demonstrated on the
[insertion algorithm]({{site.baseurl}}/tree/insertion) page.
