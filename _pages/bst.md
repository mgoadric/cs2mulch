The *Acorn* deck consists of 70 cards, numbered with integers from 00-69. The acorns
on each card are one of seven colors, where the colors are assigned based on the value
of the acorn modulus 7. The leaves on these cards incorporate visual cues to reinforce
proper sorting through a progression from green to red as the numbers increase.
Additionally, these cards can be overlapped on the corners to demonstrate
insertion and removal algorithms for binary trees or heaps.
