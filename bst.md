## Tree Deck
<span class="image fit"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bg.png" alt="" /></span>

The sorted deck consists of 69 cards, numbered with integers from 01-69. Our current design for these cards, as shown above in Figure 1, incorporates visual cues to reinforce proper sorting through a progression from green to red leaves as the numbers increase. Additionally, these cards can be overlapped on the corners to demonstrate insertion and removal algorithms for binary trees or heaps. We have begun development of a game where players are squirrels and must build a binary search tree while collecting acorns.
