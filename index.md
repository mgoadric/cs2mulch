This project will develop engaging manipulatives specifically
developed for physically demonstrating concepts in advanced data
structures. Instructors will be able to use these tools to support
lessons on sorting algorithms, binary search trees, heaps, sets,
and hash tables. Two original decks of cards will be designed,
tested, and refined that can form the basis for interactive
classroom games and collaborative peer exercises in CS2.

These decks, along with lesson plans and supporting materials, will be
made freely available, either for download and modification
through a Creative Commons license [12], or virtually through
the online board game sandbox software Tabletopia [13].
