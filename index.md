excerpt: "A collection of physical manipulatives and games to support teaching advanced data structure concepts in computer science."
---

This project is creating engaging manipulatives specifically
developed for physically demonstrating concepts in advanced data
structures. Instructors can use these tools to support
lessons on sorting algorithms, binary search trees, heaps, sets,
and hash tables.

Two original decks of cards ([Acorns]({{site.baseurl}}/tree) and
[Menagerie]({{site.baseurl}}/hash))  have been designed,
tested, and refined that can form the basis for interactive
classroom games and collaborative peer exercises in CS2.

These decks, along with lesson plans and supporting materials,
will be made freely available, either for download and modification
through a Creative Commons license, or virtually through
the online board game sandbox software [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/).
